# Dishonored_Practicum
A collection of files for my senior capstone project.
This project's goal is to illustrate my ability as a gameplay programmer.
I was heavily inspired by the gameplay of Arkane's Dishonored games.
This project is not a full game, and will not be used for anything other than expanding my abilities as a game developer.

01/24/2024 Edit:
I added in my folder of documentation.
These documents each track my progress on a given mechanic on a given day.
It covers issues that I encountered, solutions, and processes of implementation.
