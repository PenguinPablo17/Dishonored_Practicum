# Dishonored_Practicum
A collection of files for my senior capstone project for Wichita State University. Development took place using Unreal Engine 5.2-5.3.

I was heavily inspired by the gameplay of Arkane's Dishonored games. 

The project aims to demonstrate knowledge of gameplay programming and Unreal Engine game development.

This project is not a full game, and will not be used for anything other than expanding my abilities as a game developer.

## Additional Notes:
The Documentation folder contains journal-style devlogs detailing my process and tests on a daily basis, depending on what mechanic I worked on during that given day.

The Traces folder contains quicker access to the UE Trace files I generated during my optimization experiments.
