# Dishonored_Practicum
A collection of files for my Fall 2023 senior capstone project.
This project's goal is to illustrate my ability as a gameplay programmer.
I was heavily inspired by the gameplay of Arkane's Dishonored games.
This project is not a full game, and will not be used for anything other than expanding my abilities as a game developer.
